		<para>
			The <application>&SYSTEM_CONFIG_SERVICES_TOOL;</application> is a graphical application to configure which SysV services in the <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename> directory are started at boot time (for runlevels 3, 4, and 5) and which <command>xinetd</command> services are enabled. It also allows you to start, stop, and restart SysV services.

		<para>
			The <application>&SYSTEM_CONFIG_SERVICES_TOOL;</application> lists the services from the <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename> directory as well as the services controlled by <command>xinetd</command>. Click on the name of the service from the list on the left-hand side of the application to display a brief description of that service as well as the status of the service. If the service is a SysV service, the status window shows whether the service is currently running.
		</para>
		<para>
			To start, stop, or restart a service immediately, select the service from the list and click the appropriate button on the toolbar (or choose the action from the <guimenu>Service</guimenu> pulldown menu). If the service is an <command>xinetd</command> service, the action buttons are disabled because they cannot be started or stopped individually.

			<para>
				When you save changes to <command>xinetd</command> services, <command>xinetd</command> is reloaded, and the changes take place immediately. When you save changes to other services, the runlevel is reconfigured, but the changes do not take effect immediately.
			</para>
		</note>
		<para>
            To enable a service, select the service in the list and click on one of the <guibutton>Enable</guibutton>, <guibutton>Disable</guibutton> or (to enable a SysV service in other than the default runlevels) <guibutton>Customize</guibutton> buttons in the toolbar or choose the equivalent action from the <guimenu>Service</guimenu> menu. In the case of a SysV service, the runlevel configuration is changed, but the runlevel is not restarted; thus, the changes do not take place immediately.
		</para>
		<para>
			As an example: If you disable the <command>httpd</command> service, the runlevel configuration changes so that <command>httpd</command> is not started at boot time. However, the current runlevel is not reinitialized, so <command>httpd</command> is still running. Select one of following options at this point:
		</para>

			<listitem>
				<para>
					Stop the <command>httpd</command> service &mdash; Stop the service by selecting it from the list and clicking the <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button. The status of the service will be updated accordingly.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Reinitialize the runlevel &mdash; Reinitialize the runlevel by going to a shell prompt and typing the command <command>telinit <replaceable>x</replaceable></command> (where <replaceable>x</replaceable> is the runlevel number; for example, 3.). This option is recommended if you enable or disable multiple services and want to activate the changes immediately.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Do nothing else &mdash; You do not have to stop the <command>httpd</command> service. You can wait until the system is rebooted for the service to stop. The next time the system is booted, the runlevel is initialized without the <command>httpd</command> service running.
